https://rust-lang.org


If you are on Windows you may need to download VS C++ build tools and Win10 SDK and installing them then downloading rust compiler downloader and and running it...

we can make rust files and then compile them using:
>> rustc my_rust_program.rs


or we can use cargo 



>> cargo new project_name
>> cd project_name
>> cargo run 


You can see that cargo make a folder with all dependencies and ...
The largest folder is target which you can delete it 
cargo will generate it again after >> cargo run


target folder is ignored in the .gitignore so it won't get uploaded to github.



if you use vscode code runner extension compiled files will be generated beside of the .rs file.
but using >>cargo run generates compiled files in the target folder.
